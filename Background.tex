Silicate glasses are very important materials in fields including medicine, optics, electronics, telecommunication, clean energy, and waste management. The unique mechanical and thermal properties of these glasses are well documented but one of the main limitations are anomalies in the silicate structure that cause fractures to occur. Given that glass is extremely brittle, fractures may occur instantaneously when a maximum stress level is reached \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. Predicting and modeling these fractures mechanisms has been a researched extensively.

At the nanoscale level, nucleation of fractures originates from defects at the atomic structure. The fracturing cannot be explained by a “weakest link” type of description, where a single bond breaking event triggers numerous other breaks and ultimately leads to the fracture. This phenomenon also requires consideration of the local structure surrounding an atom so relating local structures to fractures is necessary. While this relation can be studied using results from MD, a repetitive simulation-observation approach is computationally prohibitive. A more tractable approach is to use machine learning and surrogate modeling techniques.

Typically in these silicate glass structures, silicon (Si) is surrounded by four oxygen (O) atoms forming a tetrahedron. These tetrahedra share one common O atom if they are neighbors. A ring forms if a group of tetrahedra share common O atoms, and the size of these rings is computed based on how many Si atoms are in the ring. A large ring has 11 and 12 Si atoms, medium rings have 5 and 6, and small rings have 1 or 2. It was also shown that increasing the quenching rates, increased the number of large-sized rings and decreased the number of medium-sized rings decreases \cite{ebrahem2018influence}. The change in the number of small-sized rings was minimal. And because there is larger void in large-sized ring, it can be stretched and deformed more than the medium-sized ring. However, medium-sized ring can take more per unit stress while tensile is applied, so it has more strain energy.

An atom is denoted as under-coordinated if the number of its constraints is lower than 4, and over-constrained, if greater than 4\cite{pedone2015dynamics}.

Classical molecular dynamics simulations were also used to investigate the properties of silicate glasses. Glasses were observed using 60k atoms for soda-silicate glasses and 30k atoms for silica glass \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. Soda-lime silicate glasses were analyzed at the nanometric scale with an atomic force microscope \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. Cavities were formed at 20nm long and 5nm deep ahead of the crack tip, and cracks would advance following the coalescence of cavities \cite{pedone2015dynamics}.

Regarding mechanical properties, Young's modulus, strength, failure strain and fracture mechanism were all used throughout the study \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. The integration of the equation of motion was performed using what is called the Verlet leapfrog algorithm. Additionally, these properties depend on both the strain rate and the quench rate. It is important to note that the glasses were heated at 5000 K, which is a temperature considered more than adequate to bring the glass into a liquid state. The heat was "equilibrated for 100ps and subsequently cooled continuously to 300 K with a normal cooling rate of 5 K/ps" \cite{pedone2015dynamics}.

With regards to stress, uniaxial tensile tests were implemented along the z-axis for both bulk glasses and nanowires \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. An important finding is such that for uniaxial tension tests in bulk glasses, in particular flaw-free silica glass, the glass was forced to break in a brittle manner \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. Additionally, in flaw-free glass, voids would grow, then coalesce before the structure would fracture. What was concluded as a result of the numerous tests performed was that the fracture mechanism of defective models showed to be less brittle compared to flaw-free glass given the unstable region is capable of expansion \cite{pedone2015dynamics}. This is an important finding given that it contradicts what is generally expected of silicate glasses.\cite{radialDistribution}
