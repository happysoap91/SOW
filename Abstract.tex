(not really common but more like our innovation)Graph network machine learning structures have been an increasingly important part of computational molecular dynamics (MD). Already, there have been techniques developed using topological constraints based on features such as atomic flexibility and internal stress of materials to predict their chemical reactivity and composition \cite{bauchy}. This project will explore and outline a novel approach to predicting fracture nucleation and fracture propagation in silicate glasses using a graph network to study local structure of silicate atoms. 

Molecular dynamics modeling at the atomic scale has been conventional method of studying fracture behavior. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have been exploring new methods to supplement and potentially replace the current methods to improve computational efficiency as well as prediction accuracy. 

This 2019-2020 Clinic project aims to implement a graph representation of the fracture system in silica glass. We will identify features in local structures of these graphs that may suggest fracture nucleation. And eventually predict fracture nucleation and propagation.
