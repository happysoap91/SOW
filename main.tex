%%% Clinic reports use the clinic class, which should be located
%%% somewhere in TeX's search path

%%% For your ``statement of work'' (or ``work statement''), specify
%%% the ``proposal'' document-class option to the hmcclinic class.

%%% The major difference between the statement of work and a midyear
%%% or final report is that the statement of work is typeset as an
%%% article, which means that the highest level of structural
%%% division available to you is section rather than chapter.

%%% There are also some changes in pagination styles and content
%%% that reflect the briefer nature of the proposal.  For example,
%%% in the longer reports, you use \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and
%%% \backmatter to separate some sections of the report from
%%% others.  In the statement of work, you don't need those
%%% commands, as no such division is necessary.

%%% Other packages needed by your document may be loaded here.
% \usepackage{url}              % For formatting URLs and other web or
                                % file references.

%%% Provide additional context around errors.

%%% Information about this document.

%%% I find it most useful to put identifying information about a
%%% document near the top of the preamble.  Technically, this
%%% information must precede the \maketitle command, which often
%%% appears immediately after the beginning of the document 
%%% environment.  Placing it near the top of the document makes it
%%% easier to identify the document, and keeps it out from getting
%%% mixed up with the real meat of the document.

%%% We use the same set of commands for specifying information about
%%% the people involved with the project that are used in the longer
%%% reports, so you can copy most of this information directly into
%%% your midyear and final reports.

%%% So, some questions.

%% What is the name of the company or organization sponsoring your project?
\sponsor{Sandia National Laboratories}

%% What is the title of your report?
\title{Graph Theoretic Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Atomic Scale Fracture in Silica-Based Glasses}

%% Who are the authors of the report (your team members)?  (Separate
%% names with \and.)
\author{Shu Cheng \and Yuri Kim \and Adam Lawrence (Project Manager) \and Corina Oroz}

%% What is your faculty advisor's name?  (Again, separate names with
%% \and, if necessary.)
\advisor{Allon Percus}

%% Liaison's name or names?
\liaison{Mark Wilson \and Thomas Hardin }

%% Did you have an outside consultant help you with this project?  Put
%% their names in the \consultant command.
%\consultant{Joseph Jones}

% \date{}
% Uncomment to manually edit date. Commented, TeX will automatically insert today's date.

%%% End of information section.

%%% New commands and environments.

%%% You can define your own commands and environments here.  If you
%%% have a lot of material here, you might want to consider splitting
%%% the commands and environments into a separate ``style'' file that
%%% you load with \usepackage.

%\newcommand{\coolcommand}[1]{#1 is cool.} % Lets everyone know that
                                % the person or thing that you provide
                                % as the argument to the command is
                                % cool.


%%% Some theorem-like command definitions.

%%% The \newtheorem command comes from the amsthm package.  That
%%% package is loaded by the class file.

%%% Note that these definitions have changed from the version in the
%%% sample report document by dropping the ``within'' argument.  See
%%% Gratzer's _Math into LaTeX_ or the AMS-LaTeX documentation for
%%% more details.

% \newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Theo1}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Theo2}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Lemma}{Lemma}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows}

\usepackage{comment}




\usepackage{graphicx}


 

%%% If you find that some words in your document are being hyphenated
%%% incorrectly, you can specify the correct hyphenation using the
%%% \hyphenation command.  Note that words are separated by
%%% whitespace, as shown below.

%\hyphenation{ap-pen-dix wer-ther-i-an}


%%% The start of the document!

%% The document environment is the main environment in any LaTeX
%% document.  It contains other environments, as well as your text.

\begin{document}

%%% In a longer document (such as your midterm and final reports),
%%% you would have separate \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and
%%% \backmatter commands to define some large chunks of your
%%% document.  For the Statement of Work, which is a short document,
%%% we don't need these commands.

%%% Your Statement of Work begins with a title page.  The title page
%%% is formatted by commands in the document class file, so you
%%% don't need to worry about what it looks like -- just putting the
%%% \maketitle command in your document (and filling in the necessary
%%% information for the identification commands above) is enough.
\maketitle

%%% In a longer document or an article being submitted to a journal
%%% or conference, you would probably have an abstract that
%%% summarized the purpose of the document.  We don't need that for
%%% a Statement of Work.

%%% Similarly, in longer documents you would probably have commands
%%% to include a table of contents and lists of figures or tables.
%%% For a short document such as the Statement of Work, we don't
%%% need these commands.


%%% Content.

%%% For smaller documents---especially those you're writing by
%%% yourself---you might write your entire report using a single LaTeX
%%% source file.  For larger documents, we recommend that you split
%%% the source file into several separate, smaller files.  The smaller
%%% files are ``included'' into your main, or ``master'' document
%%% using \include commands.  See the template file for the Clinic
%%% reports for more details on how to split a LaTeX project into
%%% smaller files.


%%% The body of your Statement of Work should appear here.  See
%%% Chapter 4 in _The Mathematics Clinic in Brief: A Handbook_ for
%%% more details on what you should include in a Statement of Work.

%%% Appendices.

%%% For your Statement of Work, you probably won't have any
%%% appendices, but you could include some if you really needed to.

%%% The appendices are delineated with the \appendix command.
%%% Individual appendices are begun with the standard \chapter or
%%% \section commands.  In our example, we'll \include them just as we
%%% did other chapters.

%%% Even in a relatively short document such as your statement of
%%% work, you might need to have appendices.  If so, uncomment
%%% the \appendix command and add them below (remember, the
%%% top-level structural command in this format is section).

% \appendix


%%% Bibliography.

%%% BibTeX is the tool to use for citations and layout of your
%%% bibliography.  Instead of having to type ``[5]'' or ``(Jones,
%%% 1968)'' (and keep track of which citation is which and renumber
%%% them as you add more references to your bibilography), you use
%%% special commands that allow BibTeX and LaTeX to automatically put
%%% the correct information in the right place.

%%% Section 5.6 in _The Mathematics Clinic in Brief: A Handbook_,
%%% talks about using BibTeX to format your bibliography and
%%% citations.

%%% Depending on your field, it may or may not be appropriate to list
%%% references for which you haven't included specific citations.  If
%%% your field sanctions such practices, or if you just want to get an
%%% idea of what you have in your bibliography file, you can include
%%% everything with the \nocite{*} command.          

%%% The appearance of your bibliography and citations in your text are
%%% defined by a combination of any bibliography-related LaTeX
%%% packages (such as natbib, harvard, or chicago) and the particular
%%% bibliography style file that you load with the \bibliographystyle
%%% command.  Bibliography-style files end in .bst; you can find them
%%% by searching your file system using whatever tools you have for
%%% doing searches.  (On most modern Unices, ``locate .bst'' will give
%%% you an idea of what's available.)

%%%%\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}

%%% The particular bibliography data file or files that you want to
%%% use are specified with the \bibliography file.  Multiple files are
%%% separated by commas.

%%% You might want to use multiple bibliography (or ``bib'') files if
%%% you had a master bib file containing references you use again and
%%% again, and another containing only records for references for a
%%% particular project.

%%% Many people create a single, large bib file that they use for
%%% everything they write.  That approach requires you to \cite every
%%% reference that you want to use in your document -- using
%%% \nocite{*} with a huge bibliography database will give you a large
`%%% bibliography containing many references you haven't consulted for
%%% your particular document!
\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
\small
%\nocite{*}
\bibliography{Bibliography}


%%% Glossary or Index.

%%% Having a glossary or index in a statement of work is overkill.
%%% Just define your terms in the text and you'll be fine.
